### **SQL Questions**

#### **1. Retrieve Restaurant Data from Specific Cities**
**Query:**
```sql
SELECT r.name, r.city, r.reviews_count, AVG(rv.stars) AS avg_rating
FROM restaurants r
JOIN reviews rv ON r.restaurant_id = rv.restaurant_id
WHERE r.city IN ('Mumbai', 'Bangalore')
GROUP BY r.restaurant_id, r.name, r.city, r.reviews_count
HAVING COUNT(rv.review_id) >= 20 AND AVG(rv.stars) >= 4.8;
```

---

#### **2. Find Average Orders Per Customer in Each City**
**Query:**
```sql
SELECT r.city, AVG(order_count) AS avg_orders_per_customer
FROM (
    SELECT o.customer_id, r.city, COUNT(o.order_id) AS order_count
    FROM orders o
    JOIN restaurants r ON o.restaurant_id = r.restaurant_id
    GROUP BY o.customer_id, r.city
) subquery
GROUP BY city;
```

---

#### **3. Click-Through Rate for Restaurant Views and Orders**
**Query:**
```sql
SELECT rv.restaurant_id, 
       COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) * 1.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT rv.view_id) AS click_through_rate
FROM restaurant_views rv
LEFT JOIN orders o 
ON rv.restaurant_id = o.restaurant_id AND rv.user_id = o.user_id
GROUP BY rv.restaurant_id;
```

---

#### **4. Average Vacant Days in 2023 for Active Restaurants**
**Query:**
```sql
SELECT r.restaurant_id, 
       AVG(DATEDIFF(COALESCE(MIN(rsv.checkin_date), '2023-12-31'), 
                    COALESCE(MAX(rsv.checkout_date), '2023-01-01'))) AS avg_vacant_days
FROM restaurants r
LEFT JOIN reservations rsv 
ON r.restaurant_id = rsv.restaurant_id
WHERE r.is_active = 1 AND YEAR(rsv.checkin_date) = 2023
GROUP BY r.restaurant_id;
```

---

### **Power BI Questions**

#### **1. Create a Dynamic Visual**
**Steps:**
1. Create slicers for `Date` and `Restaurant Type` in Power BI.
2. Drag `City` to the Axis and `Order Count` (from orders table) to the Values.
3. Apply slicer filters so the bar chart updates dynamically.

---

#### **2. Write a DAX Measure**
**DAX Formula:**
```DAX
WeekOverWeekGrowth = 
VAR CurrentWeek = MAX('Orders'[WeekNumber])
VAR PreviousWeek = CurrentWeek - 1
RETURN
    (CALCULATE(SUM('Orders'[OrderCount]), 'Orders'[WeekNumber] = CurrentWeek) - 
     CALCULATE(SUM('Orders'[OrderCount]), 'Orders'[WeekNumber] = PreviousWeek)) /
    CALCULATE(SUM('Orders'[OrderCount]), 'Orders'[WeekNumber] = PreviousWeek)
```

---

#### **3. Calculated Columns vs. Measures**
**Key Differences:**
- **Calculated Columns**:
  - Computed row-by-row during data load or refresh.
  - Useful for row-level calculations like "Age = Todayâ€™s Date - Birth Date."
  - Stored in the model and increases model size.
  
- **Measures**:
  - Computed dynamically during query execution.
  - Useful for aggregate calculations like "Total Sales" or "Average Orders."
  - Does not increase model size.
  
**Real-World Use Case**: 
Use a calculated column for categorizing orders (e.g., "Small" or "Large"). Use a measure to calculate total revenue dynamically.

---

#### **4. Implement Row-Level Security (RLS)**
**Steps:**
1. Create a new role in Power BI Desktop (e.g., "RestaurantOwner").
2. Apply the DAX filter:
   ```DAX
   [OwnerID] = USERPRINCIPALNAME()
   ```
3. Publish to the Power BI Service and assign users to the role in Security Settings.

---

#### **5. Cumulative Revenue Calculation**
**DAX Formula:**
```DAX
CumulativeRevenue = 
CALCULATE(
    SUM('Orders'[Revenue]),
    FILTER(
        ALL('Orders'),
        'Orders'[OrderDate] <= MAX('Orders'[OrderDate])
    )
)
```

---

#### **6. KPI for Occupancy Rates**
**Steps:**
1. Create a measure for occupancy rate:
   ```DAX
   OccupancyRate = SUM('Reservations'[OccupiedSeats]) / SUM('Restaurants'[TotalSeats])
   ```
2. Add a KPI visual, setting the Occupancy Rate as the value, and color-code based on thresholds.

---

#### **7. Custom Fiscal Year Date Table**
**Steps:**
1. Create a new date table using DAX:
   ```DAX
   DateTable = 
   ADDCOLUMNS(
       CALENDAR(DATE(2024,7,1), DATE(2025,6,30)),
       "FiscalYear", IF(MONTH([Date]) >= 7, YEAR([Date]), YEAR([Date]) - 1),
       "FiscalQuarter", "Q" & ROUNDUP(MONTH([Date]) / 3, 0)
   )
   ```

---

#### **8. Top Restaurants by Revenue**
**DAX Formula:**
```DAX
Top10Restaurants = 
TOPN(
    10,
    SUMMARIZE(
        'Orders',
        'Orders'[RestaurantID],
        "TotalRevenue", SUM('Orders'[Revenue])
    ),
    [TotalRevenue], DESC
)
```

---

#### **9. Repeat Customer Analysis**
**DAX Formula:**
```DAX
RepeatCustomers = 
COUNTROWS(
    FILTER(
        SUMMARIZE(
            Orders,
            Orders[CustomerID],
            "OrderCount", COUNT(Orders[OrderID])
        ),
        [OrderCount] > 1
    )
)
```

---

#### **10. Data Cleaning in Power Query**
**Steps:**
1. Remove duplicates using the `Remove Duplicates` option in the Transform tab.
2. Use `Replace Values` to standardize restaurant names.
3. Split columns, trim whitespace, and handle missing values with `Replace Errors`.
